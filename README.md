# Diploma Project for the Web Development Course - Practicum (Front-end Part)
This is a description of a diploma project completed as part of a web development course called Practicum. The project focuses on the front-end development and involves creating an application for searching movies using The Movie Database (TMDB).

The application allows users to search for movies based on the TMDB database. Users can add their favorite movies to a list, remove them from the list, and store their saved movies in their user account.

## The project makes use of various technologies, including:

### CSS:
* Flexbox and Gridlayout: These CSS techniques are utilized to create a responsive grid layout for the application's pages.
* Responsive Design: The application is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes by employing media queries, relative units of measurement for components, and CSS functions.
### HTML:
* Semantic Tags: Semantic HTML tags are incorporated to enhance the accessibility and structure of the page for users.
### React:
* Functional Components: The main components of the project are organized using functional components.
* Hooks: React hooks are employed to manage component state and lifecycle effectively.
* Custom Hooks: Custom hooks are created to handle form validation and pagination.
* Interactive Components: The application provides an interactive user experience through a declarative approach to component and layout changes. This is achieved by modifying component states, passing states between components, and utilizing Redux for data management.
* Integration with Redux: The project utilizes Redux for managing the application's data store and browser cookie storage to implement data caching.
* React Router: React Router is utilized for handling routing within the application.
### Server Communication:
* REST API: The client-server data exchange is facilitated through REST API.
* Fetch API and Redux Toolkit: Requests to the server are made using Fetch API and Redux Toolkit for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
* Back-end part on GitHub: [Back-end](https://github.com/OlgaTananova/movies-explorer-api)

App is deployed on Render: [Movies-explorer](https://movies-explorer-bnzw.onrender.com)
